🍯 honeybot py
=============

📮 About
-------

HoneyBot is a python-based IRC bot. (**python3.7**)

Feel free to contribute to the project! # |alt text|

🕹 Project Motivation
--------------------

Implementing the project in Java was weird, py's connect was sleek.
Thus, the project stack was shifted over to Python. If you can think of
any features, plugins, or functionality you wish to see in the project.
Feel free to add it yourself, or create an issue detailing your ideas.
We highly recommend you attempt to implement it yourself first and ask
for help in our `discord server <https://discord.gg/E6zD4XT>`__ !

Psst. since i learnt py through this bot, we decided to keep a
new-comers friendly policy. Feeling lost? Just ping.

:thought\_balloon: Project Testimonials
---------------------------------------

[@TannerFry](https://github.com/TannerFry)

    With experience in programming in Python, and implementing an SMTP
    email plugin for a different system, picking up HoneyBot and
    following the documentation provided for new-comers made it very
    simple to implement the same SMTP email plugin to the HoneyBot
    system. This was my first time contributing to an open-source
    project on GitHub and it was an overall great experience. The
    welcoming of new contributors and documentation on how to contribute
    and implement plugins is great for people who have never contributed
    to a project before, and Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer was extremely
    helpful when answering my questions and helping me along the way.

[@RiceAbove](https://github.com/RiceAbove)

    HoneyBot is my first time collaborating to an open source project
    and I'm loving it. Before discovering HoneyBot, I was very
    intimidated on the idea of working with other people and had no idea
    what an IRC even was. Now I realize how much fun and rewarding it is
    to work together on a project with dedicated and friendly
    individuals. The documentation is easy to follow and everyone is
    super helpful. I highly recommend any new programmer who want to
    contribute on an open source project to try out HoneyBot. Personally
    I enjoy working on this project more than my own schoolwork.

[@justinwalker4179](https://github.com/IronPenguin4179)

    HoneyBot is my first open source project and I had never worked with
    an IRC before. For school I was required to contribute to projects,
    but it was always so intimidating to me. I had always heard it gets
    easier once you've gotten over the fear wall, and that's what
    HoneyBot did for me. Excellent readme and quick feedback allowed me
    to make my first plugin. Now I've made many contributions, and look
    forward to any new issues I can get my hands on. Abdur-Rahmaan
    Janhangeer has been extremely helpful and I owe him and this project
    a lot for getting me into the open source world.

[@mboekhold](https://github.com/mboekhold)

    HoneyBot is a very friendly and welcoming community. They provided
    quick feedback and I would defenitely recommend this project to
    newcomers to give them that first boost on contributing to open
    source. HoneyBot helps you all the way there to issuing your first
    PR, step by step. I contributed a comic plugin, and I was thankful
    for meeting all the friendly and passionate people who are active in
    this community.

🔧 Plugins Development
---------------------

including it here. let's begin

a plugin has the following structure:

.. code:: python

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    """
    [greet.py]
    Greet Plugin
    [Author]
    Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer, pythonmembers.club
    [About]
    responds to .hi, demo of a basic plugin
    [Commands]
    >>> .hi
    returns hoo
    """


    class Plugin:
        def __init__(self):
            pass

        def run(self, incoming, methods, info, bot_info):
            try:
                if info['command'] == 'PRIVMSG' and info['args'][1] == '.hi':
                    methods['send'](info['address'], 'hooo')
            except Exception as e:
                print('woops plugin error ', e)

we see four parameters being passed to the run method
``, incoming, methods, info, bot_info)``

parameter1: incoming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``incoming`` is the raw line and is not used except if you are not
satisfied with the already provided methods

parameter2: methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``methods`` is a dictionary of methods to ease your life. a quick look
at `main.py <honeybot/main.py>`__ reveals

.. code:: python

    def methods(self):
            return {
                    'send_raw': self.send,
                    'send': self.send_target,
                    'join': self.join
                    }

where ``send_raw`` allows you to send in any string you want, thereby
allowing you to implement any irc protocol from scratch

but, for most uses, ``send`` allows you to send a message to an address
``methods['send']('<address>', '<message>')``. using it in conjunction
with info parameter allows you to send messages where it came from, in
pm to the bot or in a channel. you can however hardcode the address.

``join`` allows you to join a channel by
``methods['join']('<channel name>')``

parameter3: info (meaning message info)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

for a normal run, info produces

.. code:: python

    {
    'prefix': 'appinv!c5e342c5@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.200.200.22.200',
    'command': 'PRIVMSG',
    'address': '##bottestingmu',
    'args': ['##bottestingmu', 'ef']
    }

hence if you want messages, ``messages = info['args'][1:]`` or the first
word if you want to check for command will be ``info['args'][1]``

**use example**

-  the command info is used in the join channel plugin to detect a join
   command and greet the user who just joined

bot info
~~~~~~~~

bot\_info returns info about the bot

.. code:: python

            return {
                'name': self.name,
                'special_command': self.sp_command,
                'required_modules': self.required_modules,
                'owners': self.owners,
                'time': self.time,
                'friends': self.friends
            }

so that in run method you can access those.

**use example**

-  For example, the time info is used in the uptime plugin by minussing
   it from the current time to get time bot has been running.
-  The required modules is used in the installed plugin to determine
   what required plugin the bot runner did not install

wrapping up
^^^^^^^^^^^

hence

.. code:: python

    if info['command'] == 'PRIVMSG' and info['args'][1] == '.hi':
        methods['send'](info['address'], 'hooo')

from above means

::

    if message received == .hi:
        send(address, message)

⚡ Quickstart
------------

-  specify your details in
   `CONNECT.conf <https://github.com/pyhoneybot/honeybot/blob/master/honeybot/settings/CONNECT.conf>`__
   (already included) :sub:`~` [INFO]

server\_url = chat.freenode.net port = 6667 name = appinventormuBot
:sub:`~` - run run.py

💻 Seeing The Bot In Action
--------------------------

Get an IRC client

-  Web: `Kiwiirc <https://kiwiirc.com>`__ (easy)
-  Desktop: `Hexchat <https://hexchat.github.io>`__
-  Android: `Revolution IRC <https://hexchat.github.io>`__

configure

::

    port: 6667
    url: chat.freenode.net

then join channel ``#ltch``

you should see the bot as hbot ... or as it's name is in
`settings <https://github.com/pyhoneybot/honeybot/blob/master/honeybot/settings/CONNECT.conf>`__

📃 Contributing Guide
--------------------

-  don't forget to add your country flag here after accepted PR. i'll
   have to hunt it down on your profile if not.
-  make sure to follow PEP8

**about PR**

different changes to different files. for example, someone making a
weather plugin first he creates a new branch

::

    git checkout -b "weather-plugin"

then he commits

::

    git add *
    git commit -m "added weather plugin"

then he push to create a PR with the branch

::

    git push origin head

now let us say he wants to work on another issue, adding a joke in the
jokes plugin, he creates another branch

::

    git checkout -b "add-jokes"

after, same as before

::

    git add *
    git commit -m "added some jokes"
    git push origin head

now he wants to fix his weather plugin, he changes branch

::

    git checkout weather-plugin

works, then commit

::

    git add *
    git commit -m "fixed <issue>"

then a PR

::

    git push origin head

**Why all these?**

So as not to reject a whole PR just because of some oddities. Reject
only unneeded part.

🥄 Updating fork
---------------

Now, other changes are ongoing, what if you need the latest changes?

::

    git pull origin master

helps if you cloned your own repo. What is you want to update your local
copy of someone else repo? you do it like that

::

    cd <your/local/cloned/repo/path/here>
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/Abdur-rahmaanJ/honeybot.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream master

🔌 Todo Plugins
--------------

-  [x] 💐 humour
-  [x] 🌨️ weather
-  [x] ✉️ mail
-  [x] 🎛️ maths
-  [ ] 📥 pm when user online

☑ Allowing Plugins
------------------

in PLUGINS.conf, add the plugin to allow on a new line !
:sub:`:sub:`:sub:` calc username ```
